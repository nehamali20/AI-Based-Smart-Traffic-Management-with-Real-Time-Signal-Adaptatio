# 🚦  AI-Based-Smart-Traffic-Management-with-Real-Time-Signal-Adaptation


An AI-powered real-time traffic signal controller designed to reduce congestion and improve road safety by adapting signal timings based on traffic flow from different directions.

---

## Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **OpenCV** – For real-time video feed analysis
- **Flask** – Backend API
- **Machine Learning (TensorFlow/Keras)** – For traffic density & emergency vehicle detection
- **Firebase / Power BI** – Dashboard and analytics
- **Node-Cron (optional)** – For scheduled executions

---

## ⚙️ Key Features
- Live video feed processing to detect traffic levels
- Smart signal timer control based on real-time density
- Emergency vehicle detection using ML
- Dynamic dashboard with analytics and live status
- Alert system for high congestion zones

---

## 🔁 Workflow
1. Camera/video feed input is processed using OpenCV
2. ML model detects traffic congestion and vehicle types
3. Flask API triggers signal updates dynamically
4. Firebase/Power BI dashboard shows live analytics
5. System resets and re-evaluates periodically (via cron or loop)
